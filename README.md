Personal Portfolio Management Application


Tasks:
- Stock Page
    - price, last year data, visualizations
- user portfolio
- Allow users to set price or performance thresholds for notifications.
-  Integrate news about stocks in their portfolio or market trends.
- Transaction Simulator: Let users simulate buying/selling to see hypothetical outcomes.
- Community Discussions: Enable users to share insights or strategies within forums.
- Leaderboard: Create a virtual competition for portfolio performance.
- Dark Mode: Include a theme toggle for comfortable viewing.
- only english for now


- maybe later some educational concepts like:
    - Achievements: Introduce badges for tracking milestones like "Portfolio Diversified."
    - Quizzes: Include interactive content to educate users about investing.
    - Beginner Guides: Offer tutorials and guides for understanding the stock market.
    - Historical Market Events: Show insights from events like the 2008 crisis or dot-com bubble.


### **Database Selection**

For this app, a combination of **Relational Database (PostgreSQL)** and **NoSQL Database (MongoDB)** could work well:

- **PostgreSQL**:
  - For structured data like user profiles, portfolios, stock data, transactions, and leaderboard.
  - Advantages: ACID compliance, support for complex queries, relational integrity.

- **MongoDB**:
  - For unstructured or semi-structured data like stock news, discussions, and user achievements.
  - Advantages: Flexible schema, easy scaling for large datasets like community discussions.

### **Necessary Tasks**

#### **1. Stock Page**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Fetch stock price and historical data for the past year (using APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Finnhub).
     - Create visualizations (e.g., line charts, candlestick charts) for historical data.
     - Display current market trends and basic stock details (sector, market cap, etc.).
   - **Backend**:
     - Create an API endpoint for fetching stock data and analytics.
     - Store cached historical data to reduce API calls.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Build a stock page with a responsive UI for charts and stats.

#### **2. User Portfolio**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Allow users to add/remove stocks to/from their portfolio.
     - Show portfolio breakdown by sectors, allocations, and performance charts.
     - Calculate total portfolio performance (e.g., weighted averages).
   - **Backend**:
     - API endpoints for managing portfolio data.
     - Calculate aggregated portfolio performance in the backend.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Portfolio dashboard with interactive charts (e.g., pie charts for allocations).

#### **3. Price/Performance Threshold Notifications**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Enable users to set notifications for specific stock price thresholds.
     - Send notifications (email or push) when thresholds are met.
   - **Backend**:
     - Create a job scheduler (e.g., Celery with Redis) to monitor stock prices and trigger notifications.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Add UI for users to set thresholds and view notification history.

---

#### **4. News Integration**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Fetch and display stock news (using APIs like NewsAPI or Finnhub).
     - Filter news based on stocks in the userâ€™s portfolio.
   - **Backend**:
     - API integration for fetching stock-related news.
   - **Frontend**:
     - News feed UI with filtering options.

---

#### **5. Transaction Simulator**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Allow users to simulate stock purchases/sales.
     - Track and display hypothetical portfolio growth.
   - **Backend**:
     - API endpoints to simulate buy/sell operations.
     - Store simulation data separately from real portfolio data.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Simulator UI with input fields for transaction details.

---

#### **6. Community Discussions**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Enable users to create, read, and reply to discussion threads.
   - **Backend**:
     - NoSQL database for discussion storage.
     - API endpoints for CRUD operations on threads and comments.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Forum-like interface for creating and viewing discussions.

---

#### **7. Leaderboard**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Rank users based on their simulated portfolio performance.
   - **Backend**:
     - Periodically calculate and update rankings in the database.
     - API endpoint to fetch leaderboard data.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Leaderboard UI with filters (e.g., weekly, monthly).

---

#### **8. Dark Mode**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Add a toggle for light/dark mode in the UI.
   - **Frontend**:
     - Use CSS variables or a UI framework with built-in dark mode support.

---

#### **Future Educational Concepts**
   - **Achievements**: Backend to track user milestones and a frontend to display badges.
   - **Quizzes**: API for quiz questions and a UI for quiz interactions.
   - **Beginner Guides**: Static or dynamically fetched guides with interactive sections.
   - **Historical Events**: Database for historical data and visualizations for impactful events.

---

### **General Workflow**

1. **Backend Development**:
   - Set up PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for unstructured data.
   - Design API endpoints for each feature (e.g., `/stocks`, `/portfolio`, `/news`, `/notifications`).
   - Implement background jobs (e.g., for notifications, leaderboard updates).

2. **Frontend Development**:
   - Use React/Angular/Vue.js for the UI.
   - Integrate frontend with backend APIs.
   - Use charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations.

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for backend APIs and frontend components.
   - Perform integration and UI testing for a seamless experience.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Host the backend on platforms like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud.
   - Host the frontend on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Create detailed user guides and developer documentation.
